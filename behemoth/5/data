ssh -p 2221 behemoth5@behemoth.labs.overthewire.org
pass: aizeeshing

Workflow:
	1. Open the pass file as stream with `fopen`.
	2. seek the file stream to 2 offset.
	3. Get the file pos indicator.
	4. Add 1 to the pos indicator.
	5. Reset the pos indicator to the start of the file.

	After a while, I stopped analyzing the code in depth,
	and decided to just skim through it, at the end I noticed
	that there was some networking involved, especially noticed the
	`socket` and `sendto` and most importantly the `1337` port.

	Combine that information with the fact that I saw the flag was being opened at the beginning,
	I decided to start a UDP server on 1337 using `ncat`, just to give it a shot.
	I ran `ncat -lu -p 1337`, and then sent it to the background using `Ctrl ^Z` and `bg`.
	Then I ran the binary `/behemoth/behemoth5` and I wasn't quite surprised to see that the password was sent over the socket!

	Amazing!
	Sometimes you don't have to understand every bit of the code,
	and skimming through might give you the faster solution.
